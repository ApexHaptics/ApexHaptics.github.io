Recent growth in the VR/AR market has largely focused on the technology surrounding the optical display. Meanwhile, most human-computer interaction solutions for VR remain relatively constrained to traditional controllers, motion capture, and possibly wearable haptics. Apex Haptics addresses the need for a large-scale force feedback solution with a grounded reference frame for simulating static and dynamic forces when interacting with virtual objects in a room-scale VR or AR environment.
