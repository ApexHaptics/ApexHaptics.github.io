Finally the materials for the base have arrived! This time we went with 4"x2" aluminum C-brackets. With our previous design, the base members were twisting under load. This new design will ensure the base can support the new motors (20x heavier than previously) without twisting or bending under load.

We'll be machining these boys shortly!
