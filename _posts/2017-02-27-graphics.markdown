For the past couple weeks the software part of the project entered its major design phase. Part of this effort is the graphics for the virtual reality system. For budget reasons, the VR hardware used for the project is the Google cardboard.

The backbone of the system is the Google view Java API, with the graphics drawn in OpenGL. This required a bit of overhead work to get the system drawing. We created an Android program for loading asset files, starting the OpenGL call into the game object, and some shaders to do the drawing work. But now that that has finished we can start sharing what the VR environment will look like.

As you can see, it is a humble start. But the objects are clearly being drawn and respond to the user moving their head. The graphic style is a cell shaded look. This is in part to create a lighthearted environment for the user and to save on graphic asset development.

Later, some of the assets are be replaced with more complete versions, and the lighting shaders get a much needed update.

The simple shader is then replaced with a three part outdoor lighting shader. One light for the sun, sky, and ground. However the sky itself looks a little off and the fog takes on a somewhat toxic yellow colour.

This last update replaces the shy and fog. the fog is made more white and burns off to meet the sky and the sun is painted onto the sky. Notice the simulated diffraction on the of of the light around the sun.

The graphics still need more game assets and code to move, but things are advancing at an encouraging pace.
