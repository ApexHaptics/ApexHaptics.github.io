Lots of work got done this week on the electrical and mechanical side. The robot lower links, and two of the three motor branches were machined. We've put our electronics order in, so we should be getting our power supply and all electronics within a couple days. With all the electronics specced out, modelling the electronics enclosure can be completed!

To adapt the motor shaft to the lower link, we connect the lower link to adapter blocks, which connect to the shaft by set screws. The connection uses 2" #2-56 threaded rod. It turns out nobody local has it. After racking our brains for a while trying to come up with an alternative solution, we gave in and ordered some off McMaster-Carr. The shipment should come this week, and we can fully assemble the robot then. Fingers crossed that we won't have too more issues!

To conclude this week's update, here's a little preview of our enclosure. It'll be hand made (by us, of course) out of 1/16" steel sheet metal. Drilling the ventilation holes will be unfortunate, to say the least.
