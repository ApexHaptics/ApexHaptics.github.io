Lot's of work got done this week on the electrical and mechanical side. The robot lower links and two of the three motor branches were machined. Additionally, we've put our electronics order in, and should be getting our power supply and all electronics within a couple days. With all the electronics specced out, modeling the electronics enclosure can be completed!

To adapt the motor shaft to the lower link, we connect the lower link to adapter blocks, which connect to the shaft by set screws. The connection uses 2" #2-56 threaded rod. It turns out nobody local has it. After racking our heads for a while trying to come up with an alternative, we gave in and order some off McMaster-Carr. The shipment should come this week, and we can fully assemble the robot then. Fingers crossed that we won't have too more issues!

To conclude, here's a little preview of our enclosure. It'll be custom made out of 1/16" steel sheet metal. Drilling the ventilation holes will be unfortunate, to say the least.
